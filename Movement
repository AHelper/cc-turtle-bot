On start, needs to build starting spot.  For that, needs to find ground.  Must go down until a block is hit.  From there, detect the type of block.  
If it is a building surface, then scan the plot's ground.  If it is buildable, then mark it.

This isn't very flexible.  It is expecting a vanilla world.  What about crazy worlds, like skyblock, flatlands?  Should that just be specified to it?
