CC-Turtle-Bot
================

This repository houses a goal/action-based AI made for ComputerCraft Turtles.  A combination of a Tornado-powered Python server and a Lua core allow a large amount of turtles to work autonomously on a Minecraft world based on a set of goals.

The code is still in a planning phase and is not near completion.
